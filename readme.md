# Spotify Clone - Homepage

This is a basic, non-responsive clone of the Spotify homepage created using only HTML and CSS.

## Project Overview

This project is a part of my learning journey in web development. The goal was to replicate the look and feel of the Spotify homepage using fundamental HTML and CSS techniques. 

### Features:
- Basic layout of the Spotify homepage.
- Replicated design elements such as headers, footers, and content sections.

### Future Improvements:
- **Responsiveness:** I plan to make the website responsive so it works well on various screen sizes.
- **Additional Pages:** Expanding the project to include other pages (e.g., Browse, Library).
- **JavaScript Functionality:** Adding interactive elements like a working search bar or play buttons.
